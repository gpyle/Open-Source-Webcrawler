### Welcome to the Open Source Webcrawler

#### This python program is a webcrawler that searched products on Amazon and returns the number of reviews, number of stars, product title, whether or not the product is sold with prime, and the product selling price. 


### In this python webcrawler, we use regular expressions to find special sequences of characters that help you match or find other strings or sets of strings.
### For example the re.findall (?<=...) regular expression is called a positive lookbehind assertion.
### The syntax for regular expressions in python is re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0).

### Step-1 finds and lists the ASIN Amazon bar codes from any top 100 best sellers list on Amazon.

### Step-2 searches every product on Amazon in the run.txt file, and returns the number of reviews, the number of stars, and the product title.

### Step-3 searches every product on Amazon in the run.txt file, and lets you know if the product is sold with prime and lets you know the product selling price.

### Enjoy!
